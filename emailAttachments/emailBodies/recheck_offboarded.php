<p>Hello &&candidate_first_name&&</p>
<p>You have PES clearance for a UKI IBM FSS accountthat has a revalidation requirement.  It is now within 8 weeks of your revalidation date.</p>
<p>We have been advised that you are <b>offboarding/offboarded</b> from the contract.' 
<p>If you have offboarded  - you do not need to go through this revalidation process, however your clearance will be revoked and you will be required to go through <b>full PES</b> if you return to this account in the future.   If we <b>do not hear</b> from you within <b>5 working days</b> we will assume that you do not want to move forward and your PES will be <b>revoked.</b></p>
<p>If you would like to <b>retain</b> your PES (either because you are still working on the account or you would like to have it for future use), please contact us and we will progress you further.</p>
<p>If you have any questions please contact the PES Team.</p>
<p>Many Thanks for your cooperation</p>
